# Chatbot
Here we will be using `ChatterBot` Library in Python to build Chatbot


Use of chatbot is essential in this fast pace social support (Use of conventional language Engine)

1. Use of Python Library will make it more flexible to intergate and make API for futher exposure
2. Automated Response
3. Use of Machine Learning Algorithm 
4. Language Independent
5. Train Data


When it come to conversation bot its very limited

## How it will work

1. Caputure Input form the User
2. Process the input value and return the value that generates highest `confidence value` from the logic
3. Return the response for the input

## How you will train the chatbot

- There is libaray called `Chatbot-corpus` then train the `Bot`
- It is the corpus of the data inclined in the chatterbot module 
- We will have the relavent response 

## Use Case - Here we will develop a `FLASK` chatbot

1. Make a Web application using flask
2. Add the chatbot to the Web App
3. Train the bot 
4. Check Conversation with the bot *[Result]*
